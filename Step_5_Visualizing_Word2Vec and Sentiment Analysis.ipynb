In the weeks before the referendum, starting on May 12, the UK geo-located Brexit-related tweets were continuously collected resulting in a dataset of around 4.5 million (4,508,440) tweets from almost one million (998,054) users. A large sample of the collected tweets (35,000) was manually labeled for the stance of their authors regarding Brexit: Positive (supporting Brexit), Negative (opposing Brexit), or Neutral (uncommitted). The labeled tweets were used to train a classifier which then automatically labeled all the remaining tweets.\n",

    " David Cameron as Prime Minister and Jeremy Corbyn as leader of the Labour Party for Remain, Boris Johnson as Major of London and Nigel Farage as the leader of the UKIP for Leave\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " As the mayor of London, **Boris Johnson was one of the most prominent faces of the Vote Leave campaign**. Surprisingly, he did not make much use of Twitter during the Brexit campaign. Not only did he tweet less than the other leaders analysed for this study: he also had considerably less followers. In between 20 February 2016 and 23 June 2016, he just tweeted 84 times in total, or 0.7 times per day. Of those 84 tweets, only 47 were Brexit-related, and most of them (36) were posted in June. At the same time, the number of his followers went from 78,000 in mid-February to 134,000 in mid-June, still leaving him far behind Nigel Farage, who started out with 257,000 followers in February.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " David Cameron\n",
    "David Cameron did not just set the date for the EU referendum, but he was also the one fighting the strongest for Remain – at least on Twitter. As Prime Minister, he had more followers than all the other three leaders together: 1.36 million in mid-February and 1.49 million in mid-June. Cameron frequently used Twitter, on average 2.3 times per day, or 291 times in total between 20 February 2016 and 23 June 2016. Of those 291 tweets, 207 were Brexit-related, most of them posted in June (118).\n",

    " Nigel Farage\n",
    "The leader of the UK Independence Party spent most of his political career campaigning for the UK’s withdrawal from the EU. Not surprisingly, he turned out to be one of the strongest voices for Brexit on Twitter. Not only did he tweet more than any other of the four leaders, but he also had the highest ratio of Brexit-related tweets, roughly 86%. Between 20 February 2016 and 23 June 2016, he posted 579 times in total (4.7 tweets per day on average), making 500 of those tweets about Brexit, most of them in May (116). During that time, he almost gained 100,000 new followers: he had started with 257,000 at the end of January and reached 350,000 at the time of the vote cast in June.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Farage used Twitter extensively to promote Brexit. He maintained a high posting frequency and focused almost exclusively on the referendum, dedicating more than 95% of his tweets in February, March, and June 2016 to Brexit (slightly less in April and May).\n",

    "### Opening:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we use the Brexit as a case study and use data related to it to perform several NLP tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction:\n",
    "Brexit was the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 31 January 2020. The UK is the only sovereign country to have left the EU. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Brexit is a very interesting issue both because of its precedential characteristic and because of its huge impact.\n",
    "Many studies have been done to investigate the Brexit, its origin, reasoning, impact, etc.\n",
    "We will focus on several issues regarding Brexit and use NLP techniques for this research.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Brexit issue occupied the british people from 1975, where the first referendum on leaving the European Union was conducted, this issue came back in 2016 where another referendum on leaving the European Union was conducted again. There is huge difference between those 2 referendum as the second one was conducted in the social media era where there are numerous of influencers, as known as \"Key Opinion Leaders\" (KOL), who are usually at the forefront of public opinion and followed by a massive number of users and influenced the public and convince it to vote for leaving/staying in the Eu.\n",
    "It is quite known that some influencers, who want to be popular, \"change their mind\" and as they understand the mainstreem, and are in favour of the most popular agenda, this is known as populism. We wish to investigate if such a phenomena happened among the main Key Opinion Leaders in the Brexit issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do that we will do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **TASK 1**\n",
    "1. Research and find X Key Opinion Leaders in the Brexit\n",
    "2. Retrive their tweets between Jan 2014 - Feb 2020\n",
    "3. Filter the tweets so we will have only tweets on Brexit\n",
    "4. Subset each KOL tweets to 7 groups: 2014 tweets | 2015 tweets | 2016 tweets | 2017 tweets | 2018 tweets | 2019 tweets | 2020 tweets |\n",
    "5. a.  Doc2Vec --> create a representation of all the tweets in each group --> TSNE --> see how the location of the different KOL changed througout time\n",
    "5. b. Word2Vec --> create a representation of the word BREXIT for each KOL\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 2:\n",
    "*** Create a representation of the word Brexit using all the tweets of all KOL in 2014 / 2015 / 2016 and see:\n",
    "1. How the representation changes (put it in the same TSNE as in 5b)\n",
    "2. See which words are the most similar to BREXIT in different years\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 3: Sentiment analysis \n",
    "We can use the data in article 3 - 4.5M tweets with labels (The sentiment label), take a pre-trained sentiment analysis model and continue training it using that corpus, then use that model to classify the KOL tweets and then perform task 4:\n",
    "*** another option is to use the NLTK for sentiment analysis on Tweets of KOL we have and provide that to the model to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 4: Sentiment analysis bar chart\n",
    "Use a model of sentiment analysis to add the sentiment for each tweet of Brexit and do EDA:\n",
    "bar chart displaying .... (In the presentation I wrote something about it)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*** We can plot the difference in the sentiment for each KOL throught time....\n",
