The corpus of Brexit stance annotated tweets contains over 4.5 million tweets (tweet IDs), automatically labeled 
by a machine learning model with stance regarding Brexit: Positive (supporting Brexit), Negative (opposing Brexit), 
or Neutral (uncommitted).

The Brexit referendum was held on June 23, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the EU. 
In the weeks before the referendum, starting on May 12, the UK geo-located, Brexit-related tweets were 
continuously collected. Around 4.5 million (4,508,440) tweets from almost one million (998,054) users tweeting 
about Brexit were collected. A large sample of the collected tweets (35,000) was manually labeled for the 
stance of their authors regarding Brexit: Positive (supporting Brexit), Negative (opposing Brexit), 
or Neutral (uncommitted). The labeled tweets were used to train a classifier which then automatically 
labeled all the remaining tweets.

The data collection, annotation, model training and performance estimation  is described in detail in:
